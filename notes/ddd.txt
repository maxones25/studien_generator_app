Domains

Studies: This is a major domain that seems central to the application. This domain not only concerns itself with the definition of a study but also the attributes related to a study.

Groups: Groups seem to be logical collections, possibly of participants, that belong to a particular study.

Participants: This domain concerns itself with the individuals participating in the studies. It would handle the management of participants, their attributes, and their associated tasks and records.

Forms: This domain is all about form management. It includes forms themselves, the pages within the forms, components of those pages, and the fields within those components.

Entities: These seem like pre-defined structures (or schemas) that could be used within forms. It's like a template or blueprint for data.

Tasks: Tasks seem to be a crucial operational aspect, detailing what needs to be done by participants and tracking their progress.

Records: They are likely the outcomes or results tied to tasks. Each record seems to have multiple fields filled out, which might be based on entities.

Appointments: This domain deals with scheduling and organizing appointments, which can be linked to participants, groups, and studies.

Directors: Directors are likely the managers or administrators of studies. Study members would be about the association between directors and studies, detailing who has which role in which study.

Chats: This domain seems to focus on communication, particularly between participants and directors. This would include handling messages and chats tied to specific studies.

Configurations: With form_schedules and form_configs, this domain might be about configuring how and when forms should be presented or filled out in the context of a study or group.
