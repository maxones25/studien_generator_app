we are programming an application to conduct scientific studies and data collection. for this we have two react apps (one admin app and one study app) and a nest js backend. the backend is connected to a mysql database using typeorm. the react apps use vite as a build tool. the react apps communicate with the backend via a REST interface. The admin app is used to manage studies and study participants. The study app is used to collect data from the study participants. The app should allow to define different configurations for different studies.
