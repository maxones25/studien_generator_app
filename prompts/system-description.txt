we are programming an application for conducting scientific studies and data collection. for this we have two react apps (an admin app and a study app) and a nest js backend. the backend is connected to a mysql database via typeorm. the react apps use vite as a build tool. the react apps communicate with the backend via a REST interface. The admin app is used to manage studies and study participants. The study app is used to collect data from the study participants. The app should allow to define different configurations for different studies. it can be defined how often per week a value is queried. this can be variable (e.g. 3 times per week or month) or fixed (e.g. Monday and Friday or on the 1st of the month). furthermore, a fixed time can be defined or one defines a person-related time (e. the queries can be mandatory or voluntary. the queries can be postponed or postponement can be forbidden. if postponement is allowed, it can be defined by how many days and how often it can be postponed.
